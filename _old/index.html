          	<p>I have a degree in computer programming from Cégep de Sherbrooke. I currently work at the University of Sherbrooke as an IT Technician. I mainly code in JavaScript with NodeJs. But I also use Java and PHP on some personal projects. I also know C++, Android and SQL. I,m currently a front-end developer for a range of projects. Those projects built on a VueJs/Nuxt stack. But I've done previous projects with React and React-Native as well.</p><br/>
          	<p>I am passionate about programming, and I especially love object-oriented programming. But I have a special bond with anything related to web programming. I find web technologies to be fascinating since they change so quickly. It gives an extra challenge to stay up to date with the latest trends and technologies.</p><br/>
          	<p>I am a well organised person, and it usually shows in my code. I like to keep my code readable and well documented (when possible).</p><br/>
          	<p>I know I still have a lot to learn, but I love challenges that stimulate me to surpass my limits and learn even more.</p>

          <h2>Studies and Experience</h2>
          <article>
          	<p>To start, I didn't always study computer programming. I started at Cégep de Granby to become a Specialized Educator. This allowed me to gain many communication and teamwork skills. I then decided to study computer programming because I realized that it was my true passion.</p><br/>

          	</ul>
          	<p>I love helping and giving to others, so I have done a lot of volunteering:</p>

          <h2>My Projects</h2>
          <article>
          	<p>In the last few years I have created a few websites for small business or for non-profit organisations. None of them are online anymore. But I will be posting the code in my repos soon. I also have a side project I am currently working on for the Association Étudiante du Cégep de Sherbrooke.</p>
          	<div class="block">
          		<p>The Banque de Livres Usagés (BLU) is a used book sell held twice annually by the Association Étudiante du Cégep de Sherbooke (AÉCS). The goal is to help students save money. Students can sell their old books for a lower price to other students who need those same books. I am currently working on a new program to handle the members, books and transactions of the BLU. The repos can be found on my GitHub account.</p>

          	<div class="block">
          		<p>Madame Gourmandine was a small candy shop in Sherbrooke (it is now a canteen). It was my first professional contract. I redid the website after evaluating the client's needs, the potential visitors and reusing the theme from the existing logo. With this website I built my first CMS to allow the client to update the information easily.</p>

          	</div>
          	<div class="block">
          		<p>Divers-Gens is a non-profit organisation in Granby to aid LGBTQIA2S+ youth. This was one of the first websites I created, before I decided to study computer programming. I was on the board of directors, and we needed a new website, but we did not have the budget. I created the new website, learning how to use Javascript and Media Queries in the process. The site I created was static and did not have a CMS, but was still better than the one we had before.</p>
