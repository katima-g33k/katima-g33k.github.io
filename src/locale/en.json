      "I have a degree in computer programing from Cégep de Sherbrooke. I'm currently working for Coeurway, a company specialized in AI health care software.",
      "I love programing, it's one of my passions, and I have affinities with web programing because the technologies evolve very quickly, and I find that adds an extra challenge.",
      "With time, I've specialized myself as a frontend web and mobile developer with React and React-Native, although I've also used VueJS on occasion.",
      "In November 2022, I left home for an 8-month backback trip through Asia. Since then I have continued to travel and work remotely as a digital nomad."
