      "I have a degree in computer programing from Cégep de Sherbrooke. I’m currently working for Akinox Solutions Inc., a company specialized in health care software.",
      "I love programing, it’s one of my passions, and I have affinities with web programing because the technologies evolve very quickly, and I find that adds an extra challenge.",
      "With time, I’ve specialized myself as a frontend web and mobile developer with React and React-Native, although I’ve also used VueJS on occasion.",
      "Being a digital nomad had been a long standing dream of mine that I was finally able to realize.",
      "In November 2022, I left home for an 8-month trip to Asia. During those months I visited Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea and Japan.",
      "After a few months back home, I traveled to Columbia for a month, then back to Malaysia for 2 months before embarking on a 2 month long trip across Europe from Istanbul to Lisbon by train.",
      "All of this traveling has been done while working full time remotely."
