      "I have a degree in computer programing from Cégep de Sherbrooke. I'm currently working for Coeurway, a company specialized in AI health care software.",
      "I love programing, it's one of my passions, and I have affinities with web programing because the technologies evolve very quickly, and I find that adds an extra challenge.",
      "With time, I've specialized myself as a frontend web and mobile developer with React and React-Native, although I've also used VueJS on occasion.",
      "In November 2022, I left home for an 8-month backback trip through Asia. Since then I have continued to travel and work remotely as a digital nomad.",
      "Finally on November 8th 2024, I sold my house and all my possessions to become a full time traveler."

      "I love traveling. My first trip was to Spain with a high school group and since then I have visited so many more countries.",
      "My most ambitious trips have been a 9 month backback trip across Asia where I visited Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea and Japan. I also did a 2 month trip across Europe by train from Istanbul to Lisbon which took me to Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, France, Spain and Portugal.",
      "Earlier this year I spent 6 months in South America and fell in love with Buenos Aires.",
      "I just finished a 4 month trip across Europe. I spent a vacation in the UK with my partner. Then went to Warsaw and took the night train to Munich for Oktoberfest. Then spent a month in Belgrade, attended Websummit in Lisbon and finally spent the rest of the year in Tallinn and took a weekend trip to Helsinki before flying back to Canada for the Holidays."
