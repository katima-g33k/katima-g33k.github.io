		In the last few years I have created a few websites for small business or for non-profit organisations. None of them are online anymore. But I will be posting the code in my repos soon. I also have a side project I am currently working on for the Association Étudiante du Cégep de Sherbrooke.

			The Banque de Livres Usagés (BLU) is a used book sell held twice annually by the Association Étudiante du Cégep de Sherbooke (AÉCS). The goal is to help students save money. Students can sell their old books for a lower price to other students who need those same books. I am currently working on a new program to handle the members, books and transactions of the BLU. The repos can be found on my Github account.

			Madame Gourmandine was a small candy shop in Sherbrooke (it is now a cantine). It was my first professionnal contract. I redid the website after evaluating the client's needs, the potential visitors and reusing the theme from the existing logo. With this website I built my first CMS to allow the client to update the information easily.

			Divers-Gens is a non-profit organisation in Granby to aids LGBT youth. This was one of the first websites I created, before I decided to study computer programming. I was on the board of directors and we needed a new website, but we did not have the budget. I created the new website, learning how to use Javascript and Media Queries in the process. The site I created was static and did not have a CMS, but was still better than the one we had before.
