		I recently completed computer programming at CÃ©gep de Sherbrooke. I work at <a href="http://novomnetworks.com/">Novom Networks</a> as a analyst programmer. I mainly code in JavaScript with NodeJs, Meteor and MongoDB. But I also use Java and PHP on some personnal projects. I also know C++, Android and SQL and I am currently learning to use React-Native and Redux.

		I am passionate about proramming and I especially love object oriented programming. But I have a special bond with anything related to web programming. I find web technologies to be fascinating since they change so quickly. It gives an extra challenge to stay up to date with the latest trends and technologies.

	<p>
		I am a well organised person and it usally show in my code. I like to keep my code readable and well documented (when possible).

		I know I still have a lot to learn, but I love challenges that stimulate me to surpass my limits and learn even more.
